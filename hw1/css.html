                    to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn 
                    what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. 
                    I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to 
                    practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and 
                    suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to 
                    rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life 
                    into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms.”

                        say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding 
                        like spiders across the stars.” s
